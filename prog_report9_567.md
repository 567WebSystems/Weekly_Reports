# *Just Do IT!* - Progress Report Eight - (Week 13 - 04/09)

## What we have done so far:

### Beta Phase
Most of the tasks from last weeks' To-Do have been completed and new To-Do tasks are added. Here is the list of things we have completed doing:

1. At long last, we finally tested our first function! Holy H E double hockey sticks â€” we should have had this a long time ago. But since Professor mentioned in our meeting that testing was the number one issue (across teams) we figured we'd give it a shot:

2. For a while now, we wanted to show the data the user fills in on our form. Well we finally got around to it. It's not very pretty, but at least it's working:

3. We have removed most of the deprecated 'on*.' by adding an EventListener in our 'scripts.js'.

4. We have solved the issue of refreshing the page to get the new added events.

5. Added the success section to show the successful booking of appointment.

## What we are doing:

We are currently working to complete these goals, as posted on the team Trello board:

Adding User to a friends list will allow the user to book an appointment with another user.
This feature is currently on hold due to our recent meeting with the professor.
As a group, we came to a consensus of making the our current features more robust and clear.

## What we are going to do:

Our next steps are also posted on the team Trello board:

Although there seems to be a lot of To-Do's in our list, most of the To-Do's are to add more features and as we mentioned previously, we as a team are going back to our scoped down functions of our web system and really iron those functions out before adding new features.
