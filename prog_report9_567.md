# *Just Do IT!* - Progress Report Eight - (Week 13 - 04/09)

## What we have done so far:

### Beta Phase

At long last, we finally tested our first function! Holy H E double hockey sticks â€” we should have had this a long time ago. But since Professor mentioned in our meeting that testing was the number one issue (across teams) we figured we'd give it a shot:

For a while now, we wanted to show the data the user fills in on our form. Well we finally got around to it. It's not very pretty, but at least it's working:
