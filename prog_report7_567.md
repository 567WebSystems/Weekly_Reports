We are currently still working on this [issue](https://github.com/567WebSystems/project2alpha/issues/23) with events not immediately displaying or immediately being deleted when on the View Appointments Page.

Although, events are only displayed and or deleted after the current page is reloaded/refreshed.

## What we are going to do:

We still have a fair amount of items to complete in our 'Doing' and a good number of items to start and finish in our 'To Do'.
