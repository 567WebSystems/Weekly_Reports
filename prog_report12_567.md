# Just Do IT! - Progress Report 12 - (Week 16 - 04/27)

## What we've done so far:

### Public Release Sprint Part 1

To get ready for the public release, we have been polishing up our system's core functionality. This includes creating, reading, updating, and deleting Google Calendar events.

For weeks now, we had the issue of events not being able to update on our appointment list without a refresh. We introduced a temporary solution of performing deletes and updates on other pages, then visiting the appointment list.

In short, this is a temporary solution to [issue #2](https://github.com/567WebSystems/project-4-release/issues/2)

By staying on the same form when performing updates, the new update is instantly visible on the View Appointments table:
