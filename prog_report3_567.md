We are experimenting with Settings on Github. For example, adjusting branch protection rules to require at least two approvals before merging a branch.

## What we are doing:

We are working an an html form to send data. In consideration of the required data fields by Google Calendar (see below):

API Testing Progress:

We are following the Google calendar API: [create-events](https://developers.google.com/calendar/create-events).
So far the following was done: connect to API, read the user's calendar, and successfully added an event. As shown below:

## What we are going to do:

After get data from html form, that pass data object to back end. Insert event into our calendar using google authentication.  

We may need to create our own API, or find alternate solutions to achieve this.
