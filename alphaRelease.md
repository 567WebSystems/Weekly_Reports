# *Just Do IT!* - Alpha Release - (Week 9 - 03/12)

## Abstract
People nowadays integrate a lot of technology into organizing their daily lives. These include note reminders, electronic planner apps, virtual calendars and much more. Although these technologies come in handy, they still require a fair amount of manual work. There are many businesses that deal with clients who set up appointments daily, using some sort of scheduling system. What if users could schedule faster — without the need to manually input appointments on the other end? The problem here is that there should be a faster way to schedule appointments on a user's calendar — without the need to do a lot of typing.

A solution for this project is to create an appointment scheduling web system. The users could fill out a form and book an appointment with another user and vice versa. Essentially they would use their Google account (or other account, after sign-up) to fill out a form. Then that data would submit to the calendar of the person they want to make an appointment with. With this solution, clients will be able to set up their own appointments with anyone that uses this web system without the other end having to document those manually.

Ideally the Google API would be used for allowing authentication to Google accounts. Users could post data under their own alias. There would also be a Google Calendar API which will help to retrieve data from a user's calendar to provide available times for appointments and allow users to book them.
