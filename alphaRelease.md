# *Just Do IT!* - Alpha Release - (Week 9 - 03/12)

## Abstract
People nowadays integrate a lot of technology into organizing their daily lives. These include note reminders, electronic planner apps, virtual calendars and much more. Although these technologies come in handy, they still require a fair amount of manual work. There are many businesses that deal with clients who set up appointments daily, using some sort of scheduling system. What if users could schedule faster — without the need to manually input appointments on the other end? The problem here is that there should be a faster way to schedule appointments on a user's calendar — without the need to do a lot of typing.
Therefore solution to this problem is create an appointment-scheduling calendar system with Google integration for personal, commercial, and/or government applications.
